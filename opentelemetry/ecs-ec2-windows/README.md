### How it works

This deployment uses the the [awsecscontainermetricsd](../ecs-ec2/components.md#aws-ecs-container-metrics-daemonset-receiver) receiver by Coralogix, to collect metrics from Windows application. For windows deployments the receiver must be deployed in Sidecar mode.

```yaml
receivers:
  awsecscontainermetricsd:
    collection_interval: 20s
    sidecar: true
```

For Windows, this receiver does not support being run as a daemonset, as such, each intances of the collector must be added as a sidecar/container within the Task Definition of the container(s) you wish to collect metrics from.


### Open Telemetry Configuration

The Open Telemetry configuration is embedded in this cloudformation template by default, however, you do have the option of specifying your own configuration my modifying the template. The  The Coralogix Open Telemetry distribution supports reading configration from S3 as well as an Envrionmentat Variable. Note that Environment variables must be raw strings or Base64 is not supported.

### Image

This example uses the [coralogixrepo/coralogix-otel-collector:0.4.1-windowsserver-1809](https://hub.docker.com/layers/coralogixrepo/coralogix-otel-collector/0.4.1-windowsserver-1809/images/sha256-c436b2b29501592449e2b72a2393f4825e7216bdd62d90cb5e14463a46fafd95?context=explore) image which is a custom distribution of Open Telemetry containing custom components developed by Coralogix. The image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/coralogixrepo/coralogix-otel-collector). The ECS components are described [here](../ecs-ec2/components.md)
